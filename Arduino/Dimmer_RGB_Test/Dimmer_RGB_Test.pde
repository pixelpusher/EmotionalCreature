//
// This uses 2 Piranha RGB LEDs connected to the 
// Dimmer plug, which is on port 2 of the JeeNode.
// I used a ~600 Ohm resistor from the PWR
// pin on the Dimmer plug to the common anode of the 
// LED, with direct connection between the G and B pins
// on the LEDs and a 100 Ohm resistor between the appropriate
// Dimmer output pin and the R pin on the LED.
//
// **Note that in this configuration, a value of 255 sent to an LED
// pin is OFF and a value of 0 is ON**


#include <Ports.h>
#include <RF12.h> // needed to avoid a linker error :(

PortI2C myBus (2);  // the dimmer is on Port 2
DimmerPlug dimmer (myBus, 0x40);  // the address depends on the solder jumper on the plug


void setup () {

  Serial.begin(57600); // for debugging only

  dimmer.begin();

  // set up for group blinking
  //  dimmer.setReg(dimmer.MODE2, 0x34);

  // set up for open drain - make it white, must be attached to power
  // doesn't work very well or predictably with the pirahna rgb
  //dimmer.setReg(dimmer.MODE2, 0x10);

  // set up for totem pole - make it white, must be attached to power
  dimmer.setReg(dimmer.MODE2, 0x14);

  // these next lines will cause some strange things to happen
  // and are not advised to use if you want control over each LED
  // individually:
  // blink rate: 0 = very fast, 255 = 10s
  // dimmer.setReg(dimmer.GRPFREQ, 100);
  // blink duty cycle: 0 = full on, 255 = full off
  // dimmer.setReg(dimmer.GRPPWM, 100);
